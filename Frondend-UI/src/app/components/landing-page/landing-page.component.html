      Well begun is half done. It is the guiding HR principle of almost all
      modern organizations. If you focus on hiring right, the rest, by default,
      falls into place. Recruiting "right" is an effort-intensive process and
      the final decision balances on hope - that it all works out well. If you
      want to convert this "hope" to belief - we at SCANDIDATE can help you. A
      complete, factual and guaranteed belief so that you "Know Your Hire"

    </h1>
    <br />
    <p class="text-base">
      You anyway do it - every time an ex-employee joins a new organization,
      someone from your management team or HR is spending considerable effort in
      helping the new organization complete their background checks. Why not
      instead do it in a one-shot, structured way with SCANDIDATE and also earn
      some revenue for each of your ex-employee's records downloaded by other
      organizations?
