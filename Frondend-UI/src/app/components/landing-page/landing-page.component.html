    Well begun is half done. It is the guiding HR principle of almost all modern
    organizations. If you focus on hiring right, the rest, by default, falls
    into place. Recruiting "right" is an effort-intensive process and the final
    decision balances on hope - that it all works out well. If you want to
    convert this "hope" to belief - we at SCANDIDATE can help you. A complete,
    factual and guaranteed belief so that you "Know Your Hire"

      De-mystify a candidate's work ethic, conduct and professionalism history ·
      Eliminate Reference check and Background check as a step in your hiring
      process and reduce cycle time · Contribute to creating a universally
      effective and advantageous industry practice · Receive extensive industry
      HR reports on hiring, attrition and best practices · Motivate employees to
      work consistently even while serving notice period · Conquer the risk of
      recruitment "infant mortality" - candidates leaving immediately after
      joining
    </div>
    <div>As an Employee :</div>
    <div>
      Augment your employability with your own Scandidate record - your
      credentials can't get a stronger backing than this!
    </div>

  <h2>Why should you give your ex-employees' information?</h2>
  <p>
    You anyway do it - every time an ex-employee joins a new organization,
    someone from your management team or HR is spending considerable effort in
    helping the new organization complete their background checks. Why not
    instead do it in a one-shot, structured way with SCANDIDATE and also earn
    some revenue for each of your ex-employee's records downloaded by other
    organizations?
